I need a concise but comprehensive description of my Django app. Please analyze the code I'll share and document the app in the following format:

## Models
**[ModelName] Model**
- List key fields and relationships
- Note any special fields or behaviors

## Forms
- **[FormName]**: Brief description of purpose and key fields

## Views
### [Category/Group of Views]
- **[ViewName]**: What it does and key functionality

## Key URLs
- /[path]/ - Purpose of this URL/endpoint

## Middleware (if applicable)
**[MiddlewareName]**
- Key functionality and purpose

## Signals (if applicable)
- Description of signal handlers and their purposes

## Integration Points
- How this app connects with other parts of the project

I'll share my Django app code files (models.py, views.py, forms.py, etc.) and I'd like you to extract all relevant information while keeping the description structured and concise. Focus on the main functionality but include all important details.
