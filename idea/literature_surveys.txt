## Research Gaps and Future Directions

Based on the current literature, there are several potential areas for innovation in your project:

1. **Hybrid Recognition Models**: Combining traditional face recognition with emotion and context analysis to improve accuracy.

2. **Dynamic Privacy Settings**: Implementing more granular and context-aware privacy controls that adapt based on event type and participant relationships.

3. **Augmented Reality Integration**: Exploring AR features to enhance the photo viewing experience, potentially allowing users to interact with event photos in new ways.

4. **Federated Learning Approaches**: Implementing privacy-preserving machine learning techniques that keep user face data local while improving the model.

5. **Real-time Collaborative Editing**: Enabling multiple photographers to collaborate on event coverage with shared galleries and instant synchronization.

Your snapflow project appears to address many of the core challenges identified in the literature while incorporating modern approaches to face recognition, privacy management, and distributed processing. The multi-model approach to face recognition and your comprehensive privacy settings align well with current research directions in this field.
